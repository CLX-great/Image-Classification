# Image Classification

This repository contains an image classification project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview
The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for image classification, including:
- data loading and preprocessing
- model design and training
- hyperparameter tuning
- model evaluation and comparison

The focus is on understanding and comparing different model architectures and their behavior on image data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to data usage and privacy constraints.

## Implementation
All experiments and analyses are contained in the notebook:
- `image classification.ipynb`

The notebook is structured to be read sequentially and includes explanatory markdown cells alongside code.

## Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells in order.
